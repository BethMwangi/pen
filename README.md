> We need a better Markdown previewer.

## What is `pen`?

`pen` is a Markdown previewer written in JavaScript, aiming to *just work*.

There are literally tons of Markdown previewers out there. I love some of them,
I even made [one](https://github.com/noraesae/orange-cat) of them. Nevertheless,
We always need a better one, don't we?

Using `pen` is super simple, we don't need to install any special editor or
launch any GUI application. `pen` is just a tidy command-line tool. You can use
your favourite editor and browser. No manually refresh is even needed.

I literally use `pen` everyday, and I hope you love it too :smile:

## Install

Using [npm]():

```
npm i -g pen.md
```

## License
